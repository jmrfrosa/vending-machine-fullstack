# Vending Machine Exercise

Vending machine created using React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available features

* Keeps a collection of fresh products and plenty of change.
* Can use the coins you insert as part of your change.
* Not satisfied? Open it up and restock to your heart's content!
* Now connected to a vending machine server!

### Possible future enhancements

* Toggle between manual/automatic coin return, in order to be able to keep using remaining balance.
* Increase test suite coverage (currently only covering coin handling scripts, `helpers.js`)
* Fine-tune CSS to make it 100% mobile-beautiful.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
